# 🧠 QueueCTL – CLI-Based Background Job Queue System

`QueueCTL` is a lightweight **Python-based background job queue** that lets you enqueue shell commands, run them with worker processes, handle retries with exponential backoff, and manage a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** — all from the command line.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧾 **Job Queue Management** – Enqueue shell commands to run asynchronously  
- ⚙️ **Worker Processes** – Run multiple workers concurrently using `multiprocessing`  
- 🔁 **Retry & DLQ Handling** – Automatically retry failed jobs and move permanently failed ones to DLQ  
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** – Uses SQLite for job state tracking  
- 🧩 **Simple CLI Interface** – Manage queue, workers, and DLQ directly from terminal
